## Lessons

1. A _floating point number_ in programming is what we refer to decimal or fractional numbers with, as opposed to an integer.
2. `<input>` values are always string in Javascript, even if they're entered as numbers linguistically. Therefore, we need to convert them into the Number data type.
3. The `.toFixed()` method asks Javascript to convert the number value to a fixed decimal point with the number of places defined in the brackets e.g. `(2)`.
